Top-Down Shooter Game
Welcome to the Top-Down Shooter Game repository! This project is an exciting and challenging top-down shooter game developed as part of a university project. The game offers players an immersive gaming experience with strategic gameplay elements, intense combat scenarios, and dynamic interactions.

## Features
- _Dual Weapon_: Take control of a character armed with an SMG and a rifle. Strategically switch between these two weapons, each with its own unique characteristics. The SMG offers a high fire rate while the rifle delivers higher damage.

- _Enemy Waves_: Face waves of enemies that spawn randomly in the environment. Each wave increases in difficulty as one more enemy is added. Stay alert and strategize to survive the relentless onslaught.

- _Turret Deployment_: Obtain turrets by eliminating 10 enemies. Deploy the turret strategically to provide additional firepower. Turrets autonomously target and attack the nearest enemy until either the enemy or the turret is defeated.

- _Health Kits_: Navigate the environment to find health kits indicated by green dots. Approach the health kit spawners and wait for a random duration to receive an instant full restoration of your health. Make use of these valuable resources to maximize your survival chances.

- _Interactive Controls_: Control your character's movements using the W, A, S, and D buttons. Click the mouse buttons to shoot and use the mouse to aim. Pick up turrets and health kits by moving your character over them.
